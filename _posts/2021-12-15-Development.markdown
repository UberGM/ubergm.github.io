Hello again, I'm now currently about a week in to developing my game and thought I'd share some updates with the class. Learning Unity has been a pretty cool challenge and it's
a lot different than making 2D games, which I'm definitely a bit more familiar with. The basic concept for the game is along the lines of a 3d collectathon platformer, inspired
by games such as Mario 64/Sunshine, The Fantabulous Game, and also drawing a bit of inspiration from other strange indie games.

The game is definitely a bit memey, not in a way that I think will become super dated though, more just in a "this game is stupid as fuck lol" kind of way. I'm really just adding
whatever stupid ideas I can think off. So far I've been developing one of the first four playable worlds. The plan is to have four worlds immediatlely accessible, with access
to another major world inside of each one. I want to add a bunch of ridiculous platforming challenges kind of like those ones from Mario Sunshine, but the theme is quite goofy
like the Fantabulous game. I don't have any screenshots yet, but I plan to put some with my next update, as well as maybe a playable demo*

So far I've just been designing the world, along with one of the first major objectives in the world, which is where you scale a mountain that's got a lot of weird platforming
along it. I want to add secrets, and more obvious secrets that guide you towards the more hidden things. So far I actually haven't programmed the collecathon item that
you need to advance in the game, but I don't think that will really be much of an issue. I think each world will follow a similar pattern; One main objective that is some
sort of longer platforming goal, along with maybe 3-4 other mini objectives around the map, aswell as the seperate platforming challenges I've mentioned recently. Those seperate
ones are probably going to be the goofiest/most abstract things in the game, while the main objectives are more in line with a typical collecathon type of game.

I've also got a plan for a cool game I can start making after this one LOL. My original plan was to make a game more inspired by The Museum of Anything Goes, but I realized
making something like that with Unity is something that I'm going to need a lot more experience at, where a platformer is a pretty entry level project. My plan for another game
is a point and click style adventure, where I can make the environments in something like Blender, and then export the images and line them up in a 2D game engine, where
I'm going to have much more control over making random stuff like in Anything Goes. But I'm kind of getting ahead of myself here, I just want the idea written down so I have
some direction after I'm finished with this project.
