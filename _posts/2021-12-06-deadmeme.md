lol been a long time since I decided to do really much of anything.
Figured I'd make another update post to go look back on



It's been a MINUTE since I made this website and I was pretty ambitious when I got started but as things seem to work out I lost motivation almost immediately. Lol
While I still make beats every month or so I never make enough to make more compilations. Oh well. I'm just waiting for the day I get off my ass at this point and put all my
wasted time/effort in to literally anything. I have this idea floating around in my head right now to make a weird surreal 90's type of exploration game, kind of like
The Museum of Anything Goes. Currently downloading Unity as I write this post. This might be my best attempt at making a game, since I don't need to make some BS story.
All I really have to do is the part of game making I like; making the worlds and adding in weird easter eggs. Gonna try to take a few days to learn unity before I get
started on that project though... In terms of the other shit on here I haven't made a single animation since the one that's on here. Music is one that I actually enjoy doing
most of the time I just can never find much inspiration most of the time. Made a beat the other day that I'm pretty proud of though.

In other news I stopped smoking weed. Too many negatives that outweigh the like 3 positives. A little over a week in now and it's getting back to being the new normal.
One of the negatives was it made me lazy AF and probably the reason all my personal projects are so dead; like this website.
I actually really enjoy doing these random little projects I would just waste my time doing some complete random shit like watching YouTube videos all day or something
Whatever though I'm gonna make more of an effort to start working on shit here again. More to come soon.
