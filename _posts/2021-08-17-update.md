Hello again, just thought that I'd make an update post for the first time in a while. i havent posted anything so far on the site though, lol. even though i totally do so much with my free time like all the time.

well anyways i havent gotten a job yet, still doordaahing. started playing splitgate recently, pretty fun game. think i might start twitch streaming soon or something. idk. anyways, writing this post from my tablet. i want to get a chromebook to replace this so its easier to put stuff on my website if i ever get around to it. also might try and get some IT certifications soon so i can use it for studying or some shit and also trade school has been an idea in my head recently so i could use it for that. well anyways thats about it for this update. cya whenever i feel like posting next
